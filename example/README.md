# Distribicom workflow demo
The scripts in this directory run a single server and worker on localhost assuming that the ```main_server``` and ```worker``` 
have been compiled to their default location

### General workflow:
1. compile server and worker
2. in separate terminals run ```run_server.sh``` and ```run_worker.sh``` in respective order
3. a log with timings will be written in the directory from which you run the server
